The perceptron is the atomic unit of deep learning — a simple yet profound idea that sparked a revolution in artificial intelligence. Today, we'll build an intuitive understanding of how it works, explore its mathematical foundations, and implement it from scratch.

## Why the Perceptron Matters

<Intuition title="The Decision Maker">
  Imagine you're a bouncer at an exclusive club. You make decisions based on simple criteria: age, dress code, and whether someone's on the guest list. Each criterion has a certain importance (weight) in your decision. The perceptron works similarly — it takes inputs, weighs their importance, and makes a binary decision.

  The magic happens when we teach the perceptron to adjust these weights automatically, learning from examples rather than being explicitly programmed. This is the foundation upon which all of deep learning is built.
</Intuition>

## What Is a Perceptron?

A perceptron is a linear binary classifier that maps input features to a binary output. It's inspired by biological neurons but simplified to its mathematical essence.

<Math title="The Perceptron Equation" boxed={true}>
  The perceptron computes its output using:

  $$y = \begin{cases} 
    1 & \text{if } \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b > 0 \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$$

  Where:
  - $x_i$ are input features
  - $w_i$ are learnable weights
  - $b$ is the bias term
  - $y$ is the binary output
</Math>

The perceptron learns by adjusting weights based on errors:

<Math title="Weight Update Rule" collapsible={true}>
  For each misclassified example:
  
  $$w_i \leftarrow w_i + \eta (y_{true} - y_{pred}) x_i$$
  
  $$b \leftarrow b + \eta (y_{true} - y_{pred})$$
  
  Where $\eta$ is the learning rate.
</Math>

## How to Implement It

Let's build a perceptron from scratch in Python:

<Code language="python" title="perceptron.py" highlight="15-20">
{`import numpy as np

class Perceptron:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, n_iterations=1000):
        self.lr = learning_rate
        self.n_iterations = n_iterations
        self.weights = None
        self.bias = None
        
    def fit(self, X, y):
        n_samples, n_features = X.shape
        self.weights = np.zeros(n_features)
        self.bias = 0
        
        for _ in range(self.n_iterations):
            for idx, x_i in enumerate(X):
                linear_output = np.dot(x_i, self.weights) + self.bias
                y_predicted = self.activation(linear_output)
                
                # Perceptron update rule
                update = self.lr * (y[idx] - y_predicted)
                self.weights += update * x_i
                self.bias += update
                
    def activation(self, x):
        return np.where(x >= 0, 1, 0)
    
    def predict(self, X):
        linear_output = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
        return self.activation(linear_output)`}
</Code>

### Key Implementation Notes

1. **Initialization**: Weights start at zero (though small random values work too)
2. **Learning Rate**: Too high causes oscillation, too low slows convergence
3. **Convergence**: The perceptron converges only if data is linearly separable

## Notebook Results

<Notebook selectedCells={[3, 7, 12]} />

The notebook demonstrates:
- Training on the classic XOR problem (which fails!)
- Successful classification of linearly separable data
- Visualization of the decision boundary evolution

## Beyond the Basics

The perceptron's limitations led to crucial innovations:

1. **Multi-layer Perceptrons**: Stack them to solve non-linear problems
2. **Activation Functions**: Replace step function with smooth alternatives
3. **Backpropagation**: Enable training of deep networks

These extensions transformed the humble perceptron into the deep neural networks powering today's AI revolution.
